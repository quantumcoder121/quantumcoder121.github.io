Hi there! This is Aditya Kudre, an [IIT Bombay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Bombay) graduate in [Electrical Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering) with a deep passion for Machine Learning and other technologies. You are looking at my webpage right now! Feel free to provide any suggestions through the [Feedback Form](https://forms.gle/7epvZ7EqNfPkbAL27).

Most of my technical interests are in Machine Learning which includes Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning and Explainable AI. Some other interests include Computer Architecture (proud [RISC](https://www.arm.com/glossary/risc) fan!) and Computer Networks. 

Apart from all the tech stuff, I'm an avid Anime fan and would love to hear any [Anime recommendation](https://forms.gle/7zQ22j5jKN1yfT2q6) from you! My favorite genre include Fantasy, Action and Adventure. Have a look at my Anime list here!
